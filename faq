<p>What is the Pythagorean Theorem?</p>
<p color="gray">The pythagorean theorem is a trick that helps you calculate the value of the hypotenuse, or the longest leg, of a right triangle.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) of a right triangle, given the values of the shortest (A) and longest (B) sides are known, use the formula A²+B²=C² (make sure to square the lengths of A and B) in order to find the length of the hypotenuse. Then, you will find the C², which will give you the official length of the hypotenuse.</p>
